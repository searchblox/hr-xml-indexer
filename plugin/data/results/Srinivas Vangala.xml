Project 4 -- IDX Interface, CE Control Panel, Group Data <span inprof='y' id='357_1' class='role'>Trans
Senior Application Developer</span>

Phase - I: Coventry Healthcare has decided the Central Enrollment system (CE) will be the source system for enrollment data. In order for CE to become the source enrollment system it will need to be integrated with <span inprof='n' id='358' class='location'>the Coventry</span> <span inprof='y' id='359' class='skill'>claims processing</span> system (IDX), which has been selected to replace <span inprof='n' id='360' class='company'>First Health</span>'s claim system, First Claim. This project will modify the existing CE system components to align with <span inprof='n' id='361' class='location'>Coventry</span> enrollment processes and add the processes necessary for CE to send enrollment data real time to IDX for the Phase 1 Conversion - <span inprof='n' id='362' class='company'>First Health</span> Clients.
Phase - II: VDSAExtract, MMOExtract: The VDSA (Voluntary Data Sharing Agreement) is a project that CE (Central Enrollment) will support. CE will generate extract files containing member's eligibility information to exchange in return for response files. <span inprof='n' id='363' class='company'>CMS (Center for Medicare Services)</span> will generate the response files that report the Medicare Eligibility information for the members.
Phase - III: VDSA Reports (Load report, Error report, Discrepancy report): The VDSA Load Report, Error Report, Discrepancy is generated each time a CMS response file has been loaded into the CE database.
